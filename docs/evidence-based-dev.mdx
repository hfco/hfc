# Evidence-Based Development

We follow evidence-based development.  Designs are evaluated for performance feasibility using the Delta-Q Systems Design
methodology that has been developed by PNSol and advanced in conjunction with members of the HFC team.   This methodology
targets complex distributed systems (such as the Cardano blockchain) and allows rapid assessment of design feasibility
as well as providing guardrails for design refinement.  Where a design is possibly feasible, these guardrails indicate
how and where the design needs to be refined.

The methodology is backed by careful performance evaluation prior to every mainnet release.  System level benchmarks
are conducted on a large, consistent cluster of Cardano nodes prior to tagging a node release.  Over 40 performance 
metrics are considered and compared against a baseline.  These include time and memory usage.  Any significant regression
is investigated, and any regression that invalidates the design requirements will prevent release. In addition, micro-benchmarks
are used for early detection of performance issues as part of the Continuous Integration system.
This detects many issues early in the development cycle. In this way, the Cardano node maintains its high performance and
demonstrably meets its design objectives.

Software functionality is evaluated rigorously using property testing as well as more conventional unit testing and end-to-end testing.
Property testing automatically generates thousands of tests for each property that has been specified, narrowing failing
tests to give a simple counter-example that can be used to diagnose a problem.  Collectively, this gives a level of testing
that allows a high level of confidence in the correct operation of the Cardano node.
