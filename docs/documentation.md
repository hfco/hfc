# Cardano

Cardano is an open source project that aims to build the operating system for the world.
It is built around the Cardano blockchain, a high-reliability, highly distributed system
that uses the Ouroboros consensus mechanims to establish a verifiable chain of blocks.
Cardano is a third-generation, low-energy, low-cost blockchain that supports staking of Ada tokens,
non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts via Plutus scripts, and more.

## The Cardano DNA

Cardano is built on a number of core principles

- Research-led development
- High-assurance
- Highly decentralised

## The future of Cardano

Many exciting developments are in the works!   A multi-year research programme is in preparation
that will produce important new results in scalability, governance, blockchain services, security, and more.
This will provide a vision that will ensure Cardano has a bright, long-term future!
