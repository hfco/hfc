# Why Agda

Agda adds a new dimension of formality to programming.  It allows formal specifications to be written that can be
both proven and executed.  It integrates directly with Haskell - Agda specifications can be extracted into Haskell
modules that can be linked with existing and new Haskell code.  This increases confidence that the source code
precisely and correctly meets its functional requirements.  Why program when you can generate?
