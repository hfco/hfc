## Why Haskell?

Haskell lets me write software the way I think.   As a purely functional language, it lets me compose programs from small, easily understood
building blocks that are highly malleable and easily refactored.  It is *compositional*.

As a strongly typed language, Haskell stops me making mistakes in the code that I write.  I may need to spend some time thinking about the right
types or deciphering type errors, but that is time well spent.  Once the code type checks, it almost always works exactly as I intended.
