## Why Haskell?

Haskell lets me write software the way I think.   As a purely functional language, it lets me compose programs from small, easily understood
building blocks that are highly malleable and easily refactored.  It is *compositional*.

As a strongly typed language, Haskell stops me making mistakes in the code that I write.  I may need to spend some time thinking about the right
types or deciphering type errors, but that is time well spent.  Once the code type checks, it almost always works exactly as I intended. 
Haskell has one of the most advanced type systems of any programming language.  That means that more errors are caught, and I can write more correct programs.

Haskell cleanly separates the what from the how.  I can write a function and use it in many different ways.  Non-strictness means that I do not need to be
explicit about termination conditions or how data is consumed.
